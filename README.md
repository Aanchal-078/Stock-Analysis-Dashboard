# Stock-Analysis-Dashboard
I used the stock dataset for this project, allowing us to view the stock's high, low, open, and close prices on a yearly, monthly, quarterly, or daily basis. For all stocks, we have also prepared a brief report. We utilized HTML VizCreator and picture crousel visual to enhance the visuals.
